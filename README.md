I'm maintaining a playlist on my YouTube channel for this course which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9mj9NR7Z6a6py4Cps_odGcrwhP3O7D7

This repo contains all the stuff including code, class tasks, assignments, etc from my YouTube channel "Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development Course".

In this course, we are covering MERN Stack for full-stack web development and React Native for mobile app development.

We've started with an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are moving down the path.

##Make sure you leave a star on this repository so that you can easily find it later.
