// Chapter-39: switch statements: How to start them

// BEFORE SWITCH STATEMENTS
// program: which day of the week

// NOW USING SWITCH STATEMENT

// JUST FOCUS ON FIRST 3 LINES
// 1. Begins with the keyword switch. Bumping up against it is the variable that's being tested,
// inside parentheses. Then there's an opening curly bracket.
// 2. The first possibility, that the variable dayOfWeek has the value "Sat". Begins with the
// keyword case. Then the value that is being tried, "Sat". Then a space and a colon.
// 3. The statement that executes if the test passesâ€”if dayOfWeek does, in fact, have the value
// "Sat". This statement is indented. Any number of statements can execute if the test passes.

// IF STATEMENT VS SWITCH STATEMENT
// WHY SWITCH STATEMENT
// will discuss in upcomig videos
