// CHAPTER-42: do while loops

// WHILE VS DO WHILE (SYNTAX)
// The differences between the two types of loops:

// Instead of while, the keyword do leads off the statement.
// The while clause, including the loop-limiting code inside the parentheses, moves to the
// bottomâ€”after the closing curly bracket.
// Note that the while clause ends with a semicolon.

// WHILE VS DO WHILE (FUNCTIONALITY)
// the difference between a while loop and a do...while loop is that it's
// possible to code a while statement whose block of instructions never executes.
// But in case of do-while the block of instructions always executes at least once.
