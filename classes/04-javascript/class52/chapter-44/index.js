// Chapter-44: Commenting

// JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS

// JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
// JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

// SINGLE LINE COMMENTS

// Single line comments start with //.
// Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

// MULTI LINE COMMENTS

// Multi - line comments start with /* and end with */.
// Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

// USING COMMENTS TO PREVENT EXECUTION
// Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.
// Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.
