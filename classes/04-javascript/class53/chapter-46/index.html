    <p>Chapter-46: Events: Button</p>

    <!-- In the last chapter we learned how to repurpose a link to make it trigger an event when it's clicked, instead of loading a new page. We learned to do it with inline event-handling, not the best way, but the easiest to learn. Later in the book, you'll learn the approach that's preferred by most professionalsâ€”the scripting approach.
    But even if we're using the inline method, when we want to give the user something to
    click, a more professional approach, usually, is to use a button rather than a link. -->

    Suppose that when the user clicks a button, an alert displays saying, "Hello world!"
    Here's the code.
    <input type="button" value="Click" onClick="alert('Hello world!');">
    <button onclick="alert('hi')">Say Hi</button>
    <button onclick="sayBye()">Say Bye</button><br>
    <img src="./icons/hi.png" onClick="alert('Uncle saying hi!')">

    <!-- javascript -->
    <script>
        function sayBye() {
            alert("Bye")
        }
    </script>
</body>
