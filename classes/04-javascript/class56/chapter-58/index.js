// Chapter-58: The DOM

// WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR?
// 1. getElementById
// 2. getElementsByTagName

// LIMITATIONS OF THE ABOVE
// getElementById, gives you access only to those components that have been assigned an id.
// getElementsByTagName, is good for wholesale changes, but is a bit cumbersome for fine surgical work.
