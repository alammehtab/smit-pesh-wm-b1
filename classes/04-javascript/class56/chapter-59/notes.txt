59-The DOM: Parents and Children

What is the DOM? (Quick Recap)
    The DOM is a tree-like structure where every HTML element is a node.
    The structure starts from the document object, which represents the entire page, and branches out to individual elements like div, p, h1, etc.

Understanding Parents and Children
    Parent Node: 
        Any element that contains another element is called a parent.
        <div>
            <p>Hello, world</p>
        </div>

        here, div is the parent node.

    Child Node: 
        The elements inside a parent are its children.
        <div>
            <p>Hello, world</p>
        </div>

        single child:
        here, p is the child node.

        multiple children:
        <div>
            <p>Hello, world</p>
            <span>hi</span>
        </div>
        here, p and span are children nodes.
