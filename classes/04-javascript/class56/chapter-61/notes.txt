Chapter61-The DOM: Junk artifacts and nodeType

PREVIOUS LECTURE (QUICK RECAP):
    THE DOM: FINDING CHILDREN
        children: Returns a live HTMLCollection of all child elements.
        childNodes: Returns a live NodeList of all child nodes, including text nodes, comments, etc.

WHAT ARE JUNK ARTIFACTS?
    When working with the DOM, especially when iterating through child nodes, we may encounter nodes that are not elements. These are often referred to as "junk artifacts."

    COMMON JUNK ARTIFACTS:
        Text Nodes: These are created by spaces, line breaks, or text content within the HTML.
        Comment Nodes: Nodes created by HTML comments.
