Chapter61-The DOM: Junk artifacts and nodeType

PREVIOUS LECTURE (QUICK RECAP):
    THE DOM: FINDING CHILDREN
        children: Returns only child elements (actual html elements like h1, p, span, div etc).
        childNodes: Returns all child nodes, including text nodes, comments, etc.

WHAT ARE JUNK ARTIFACTS?
    When working with the DOM, especially when iterating through child nodes, we may encounter nodes that are not elements. These are often referred to as "junk artifacts."

    COMMON JUNK ARTIFACTS:
        Text Nodes: These are created by spaces, line breaks, or text content within the HTML.
        Comment Nodes: Nodes created by HTML comments.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:
    junk-artifacts.html

    Explaination:
        Element Nodes: Represented by actual HTML tags like <p> or <span>.
        Text Nodes: Represented by text or spaces between elements.
        Comment Nodes: Represented by HTML comments.

WHAT IS nodeType PROPERTY?
    The nodeType property returns the node type, as a number, of the specified node.
    
    If the node is an element node, the nodeType property will return 1.
    If the node is an attribute node, the nodeType property will return 2.
    If the node is a text node, the nodeType property will return 3.
    If the node is a comment node, the nodeType property will return 8.
    This property is read-only.
