Chapter 69- Objects

1. What Are Objects?

    Definition: 
        In JavaScript, an object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

        Another Definition: Object is a collection of key-value pairs.

        property: variable (data) inside an object.
        method: function inside an object.

    Analogy: 
        Think of an object like a real-world object, such as a car. A car has properties like color, model, and year, and it can perform actions (functions) like start, stop, or drive.

2. Why Do We Use Objects?

    Organize Code: 
        Objects help you group related data and functionality together, making your code more organized.
    Reusability: 
        Objects allow you to reuse code. For example, you can create multiple car objects, each with its own properties but with shared methods.
    Modeling Real-World Entities: 
        Objects are great for modeling real-world entities, like a user, a book, or a car.

3. How to Create an Object in JavaScript

    The simplest way to create an object is by using an object literal. This is done by defining an object within curly braces {}.

    Example:

        var car = {
            color: "red",
            model: "Toyota",
            year: 2020
        };

4. Accessing Object Properties

    You can access the properties of an object using dot notation . or bracket notation [].

    Example:

        console.log(car.color);
        console.log(car["model"]); 

5. Adding New Properties

    You can add new properties to an existing object after itâ€™s created.

    Example:

        car.owner = "Alice";
        console.log(car.owner);
