Chapter 76: Browser Control - Getting and Setting the URL

1. Getting the Full URL
    In JavaScript, you can easily check the full URL of the page you’re on using the 
    window.location.href property.

    var currentURL = window.location.href;
    console.log(currentURL);
    This shows the complete web address.

2. Breaking the URL into Parts
    You can extract specific parts of the URL:

        Domain Name (e.g., www.example.com):
        var domain = window.location.hostname;
        console.log(domain);

        Pathname (e.g., /products/page33.html):
            var path = window.location.pathname;
            console.log(path);

        Anchor (e.g., #humidifier):
            var anchor = window.location.hash;
            console.log(anchor);

3. Setting a New URL
        You can also tell the browser to go to a new URL:
            window.location.href = "https://www.newsite.com";

        You can even use the current domain to navigate within the same site:
            var newPage = "http://" + window.location.hostname + "/newpage.html";
            window.location.href = newPage;

Summary: The window.location object is your key to controlling the browser’s URL, allowing you to get parts of the current URL or even navigate to a new one!
