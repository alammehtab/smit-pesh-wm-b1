Chapter 79: Browser Control - Filling the Window with Content

1. Opening a Popup Window
    Popup windows, though often blocked by browsers due to misuse, can still be useful in some cases. Here's how to open a blank popup window:

        var monkeyWindow = window.open();

    This opens a new blank window and assigns it to a variable (monkeyWindow). The size and behavior of the popup depend on the browser, and it may open in a new tab or a new window.

2. Filling a Window with Content: Method 1 - Using document.write()

    You can use document.write() to add HTML content to the newly opened window:

        var monkeyWindow = window.open();
        var windowContent = "<h1>Capuchin Monkey</h1><img src='monkey.jpg'><p>The word capuchin derives from a group of friars<br>named the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin who wear<br>brown robes with large hoods covering their heads.</p>";
        monkeyWindow.document.write(windowContent);

    Explanation:

        Line 1: Opens a blank window.

        Line 2: Assigns HTML content to a variable.

        Line 3: Uses document.write() to fill the popup with that HTML content.

    Tip: Inside the main double quotes (""), use single quotes ('') for any HTML attributes, such as in the src of an image tag.

3. Filling a Window with Content: Method 2 - Using location.assign() or location.href
    
    You can assign an entire webpage to the popup window:

        monkeyWindow.location.assign("http://www.animals.com/capuchin.html");
        
        or

        monkeyWindow.location.href = "http://www.animals.com/capuchin.html";

        This replaces the blank window content with the document from the specified URL.

4. Filling a Window with Content: Method 3 - Opening a Specific URL Directly

    The most common and concise method is to specify the webpage to open when creating the popup:

        var monkeyWindow = window.open("http://www.animals.com/capuchin.html");

    If the webpage shares the same host or directory as the original document, you can use a relative path:

        var monkeyWindow = window.open("capuchin.html");

5. Closing the Window

    Once you're done with the popup, you can close it programmatically:

        monkeyWindow.close();

Key Points:

    Opening a Popup: Use window.open() to create a new browser window.
    Filling Content: You can fill the popup with content using document.write(), by assigning a URL with location.assign(), or by specifying a URL directly in window.open().
    Closing the Window: Use window.close() to close the popup.

Popups can be a useful feature when used responsibly, especially in cases where additional content or documents need to be opened separately from the main page.
