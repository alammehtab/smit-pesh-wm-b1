What is utf8?
    UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a standard encoding system for representing text in computers. It encodes all possible characters (from all writing systems) using 1 to 4 bytes, making it compatible with ASCII and efficient for text storage and transmission.

utf8 vs ascii:

    Character Range:
        ASCII: 128 characters.
        UTF-8: Over a million characters.
    
    Encoding:
        ASCII: Fixed 7-bit encoding (1 byte).
        UTF-8: Variable-length encoding (1 to 4 bytes).
    
    Language Support:
        ASCII: Only basic English characters.
        UTF-8: Supports characters from all languages, symbols, and emojis.
    
    Compatibility:
        ASCII: Not compatible with other encoding systems.
        UTF-8: Backward-compatible with ASCII.

Practice Tasks:
Task 1: Read a file using both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Compare the behavior and output.
Task 2: Write a new file with some content, then append additional content to the same file.
Task 3: Delete a file and handle any errors if the file doesnâ€™t exist.
