In today's class, let's mimic a database using an array to represent a list of users. We'll create routes for adding a user, updating a user, deleting a user, and reading all users. These routes will handle the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:

GET request to fetch all users
POST request to add a new user
PUT request to update an existing user
DELETE request to delete a user
